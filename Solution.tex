		\item[Question 1.1 ] \emph{What affect does this kernel have? (Consider both this image and larger example images)}
		\\ Your answer
		\item[Question 1.2 ] \emph{What are their responses to uniform brightness? Are the filters isotropic or anisotropic and explain the terms. Which filter would you use for finding edges? What kind of edges would you use it to find?}
		\\ Your answer
		\item[Question 1.3]
		\emph{Is it possible to use the intrinsic and extrinsic camera properties to transform from a point in the camera 2D pixel coordinate system to a point in the world 3D coordinate system, and why?}
		\\ Your answer
